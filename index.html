                    1. Your Heating bills are higher than usual
                </h2>

                        <p>
                            If you’ve noticed your heating bills creeping up, it could be a sign that your furnace is working harder than it should. An HVAC technician can look at your system and determine if it needs a tune-up or if something more serious is going on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One way to keep your furnace running efficiently is to have it serviced regularly. A tune-up can identify any potential problems and help prevent them from becoming more significant, more expensive issues. Professional HVAC technicians will clean your furnace, test its parts, and make necessary adjustments. This can help extend the life of your furnace and keep it running smoothly for years to come.

                    2. Your home isn’t as warm as it used to be.
                </h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Suppose you are turning up the heat but not feeling any difference in your home’s temperature. In that case, it’s time to call an HVAC technician—a problem with your furnace or <A href="https://harmonmechanical.com/air-conditioning-auburn/ductless-mini-split-cooling-system/">ductwork is causing heat</A> to escape from your home instead of circulating evenly. You don’t want to wait until your furnace completely breaks down before getting it fixed, so call a technician as soon as you notice a problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another issue that could be causing your furnace to work overtime is an inefficient thermostat. If your thermostat is old or not programmed correctly, it might not be reading the temperature in your home accurately. This can cause your furnace to run more than necessary, which wastes energy and drives up your utility bills. Upgrade to a smart thermostat to get more accurate temperature readings and save money on your energy bills.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    If you’ve tried all of these solutions and you’re still not getting <A href="https://harmonmechanical.com/heating-auburn/furnace-maintenance/">enough heat in your home</A>, there could be a problem with your furnace itself. Furnaces typically last about 15 years, so it might be time for a replacement if yours is older. A new furnace will be more efficient and better heat your home evenly.

                    3. Your furnace is making strange noises
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <div class="two-col">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            If your furnace makes strange noises, it’s time to call an HVAC technician. These noises could signify a severe problem with your furnace and should be addressed as soon as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some everyday furnace noises and their causes include:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Banging or Popping Noises
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                If your furnace is making banging or popping noises, it could be due to a clogged burner. When the burner is clogged, the flame cannot burn as efficiently, causing these noises. Additionally, this problem can cause your furnace to overheat and shut down.
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                Hissing Noises
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                Hissing noises coming from your furnace are usually indicative of a gas leak. If you smell natural gas in your home, evacuate immediately and call your gas company. Do not attempt to fix the problem yourself, as this could be extremely dangerous.
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                Buzzing Noises
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                Buzzing noises coming from your furnace typically mean that there is something wrong with the blower motor. The blower motor is responsible for circulating air throughout your home, so if it’s not working correctly, your furnace won’t be able to heat your home effectively.
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                Rattling Noises
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                Rattling noises from your furnace could be caused by a loose part of the system. Additionally, this problem could also be indicative of a cracked heat exchanger. A cracked heat exchanger can leak carbon monoxide into your home, which can be extremely dangerous.

                    4. You’ve had your furnace for a long time

                            If you’ve had your furnace for more than 15 years, it might be time to start thinking about replacing it. An HVAC technician can help you decide if a new furnace is a suitable choice for you and your home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are a few things to remember when considering furnace replacement. The first is energy efficiency. Newer furnaces are much more energy efficient than older models, so you could significantly reduce your energy bills by upgrading to a new model.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Another thing to remember is that furnace replacement can be a sizable investment. You’ll want to make sure you choose a model that will meet your heating needs for many years. An HVAC technician can help you select the right furnace for your home and budget.

                <br>
                <p>
                    If you don’t remember the last time your furnace was serviced, it’s probably been too long! An HVAC technician can give your furnace a tune-up and make sure it’s running efficiently. This can save you money on your energy bills and extend the life of your furnace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, a technician can clean your ductwork and vents. This will help improve your home’s air quality and eliminate dust or allergens.
